What it is: Interactive Coloring Book Simulation (Teaching aid technology)
Purpose: Can be used to teach young children how to draw which has been proven to play a big role in writing and creative thinking as well as hand to eye coordination and helps with understanding how to conceptualize ideals in many occupations such as architecture and art and may disciplines of science such as organic chemistry where you have to understand structures in a 3D space.
Challenges:
The code is not complete there are few bugs. When the panada code to draw the panda is not commented out the panda will draw itself automatically which is strange because the user hasn’t prompted the panda option. One might assume that the panda pops up because the function is being called but then in those cases why aren’t the other animals being drawn because they’re functions are also being called. The other issue is that the animals may overlap onto one another on the same screen as opposed to other screens. I was struggling to find a solution for this. The third and final issue was that that a new turtle had to keep being imported for the shapes that make up the animals to assemble in the right places and make the right moves even though ideally the turtle should only need to be imported once.
Takeaways:
Everything has a sequence or order of operations and depending on when and how something is done will leave with different results. For using turtles, I realized it was basically like plotting points on a coordinate system and commanding the turtle pen to move right left up and down some many distance or degrees over. Drawing animals is basically assembling many different shapes in patterns and being creative with what kind of coding features can be considered for a design. For instance, for drawing a cheetah I could have drawn the general body for a cheetah but to create the spots for the cheetah I could have used the imported random feature and coded my project to draw any given number of spots to show up on the cheetah in a random fashion. There are so many possibilities with the shape and design of the drawings.
